💬 Intuitive Example: The AI Librarian
Imagine you’re chatting with an AI assistant at a law firm.
User:
“What’s the latest ruling on data privacy in the EU?”
The LLM doesn’t know — it wasn’t trained on last month’s court decisions. But the client performs a semantic search over a vector store of legal documents and retrieves a recent ruling.
Prompt to LLM:
“You are a legal assistant. Based on the following document, answer the user’s question:
[Excerpt from the ruling]
User’s question: ‘What’s the latest ruling on data privacy in the EU?’”
LLM Response:
“According to the ruling issued on April 12, 2025, the EU has strengthened consent requirements for cross-border data transfers…”
The LLM didn’t memorize this — it retrieved and reasoned.

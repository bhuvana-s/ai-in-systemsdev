Let’s say a user is chatting with a support bot about a specific product.
User:
“Does this laptop support Thunderbolt 4?”
The client knows the user is viewing Product ID: X123, so it fetches the product specs and adds them to the prompt:
Prompt to LLM:
“You are a helpful assistant. The user is asking about a laptop with the following specs:
Model: X123
Ports: 2x USB-C, 1x Thunderbolt 4, HDMI
User’s question: ‘Does this laptop support Thunderbolt 4?’”
LLM Response:
“Yes, this laptop supports Thunderbolt 4 via one of its USB-C ports.”
